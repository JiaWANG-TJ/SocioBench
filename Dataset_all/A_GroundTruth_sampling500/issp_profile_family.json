ISO 3166-2 is applied for the UK's subsample Great Britain. To indicate the subsamples within the ISSP countries a five digit numeric code on the basis of ISO 3166 was constructed. The first three-digits are based on the original ISO code (see V4) and indicate the country. The following two-digit numeric appendices (01, 02, 03) indicate the subsamples (see Belgium and Germany). For examining subsamples from Israel (Jewish/ Arab population) IL_REG can be used as a flag variable. PT: The Portuguese ISSP 2012 module was fielded (together with the ISSP 2013) in two rounds, the main sample including 898 interviews and a complementary sample with 103 interviews. The ISSP Methodological Committee approved the sample resulting from pooling the two rounds, which can still be separated using V3 as a FLAG variable. (More information see note).",
